## Important
Due to college computers being strange, one of our computers kept us signed in as the wrong user so a few commits were made under the wrong alias, but it was easy to fix as the commits got labeled with no profile picture. Just to be sure though, the following commit IDs belong to Alan Rondoleanu.
